In this experiment, you will take on the role of an individual running a lemonade stand.
        There will be 20 periods in which you will have to make decisions on how to run the business.
        These decisions will involve the location of the stand, the sugar and lemon content and the lemonade color and price.
        The decisions you make in one period, will be the default choices for the next period.
        At the end of each period, you will learn what profits you made during that period.
        You will also hear some customer reactions that may help you with your choices in the following periods.
