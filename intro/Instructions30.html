    <p>
Dear {{ player.name }},<br>
I have enclosed the following guidelines that you may find helpful in running your lemonade stand. These guidelines are based on my previous experience running this stand.
When running my business, I followed these basic guidelines:</p>


    <p>

        <table style="width:50%" align="center">

  <tr>
    <td>Location:</td>
      <td>Business District</td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Sugar Content:</td>
         <td>5.2%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>Lemon Content:</td>
         <td>7.0%</td>
        </tr>
            <tr>
    <td>Lemonade Color:</td>
         <td>Green</td>
        </tr>
                <tr>
    <td>Price:</td>
         <td>8.2 thaler</td>
        </tr>



</table>
</p>

With these choices, I was able to make an average profit of about 85 thaler per period.
I have experimented with alternative choices of sugar and lemon content, as well as
lemonade color and price. The above choices were the ones I found to be the best. I
have not experimented with alternative choices of location though. They may require
very different strategies.<br><br>
Regards,<br>
Previous Manager
